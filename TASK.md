# JDBC Homework Assignment

## Overview
This homework is designed to help you apply your knowledge of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) in a practical setting. You will be creating a Java application that interacts with a database of your choice. This assignment includes tasks of varying complexity to test your understanding of JDBC's core concepts.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Database Connection and Data Retrieval
- **Objective**: Write a Java program to establish a connection to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and retrieve data.
- **Requirements**:
    - Establish a database connection using JDBC.
    - Execute a SELECT query on a table of your choice.
    - Process and display the results in the console or a simple UI.

### Task 2: CRUD Operations
- **Objective**: Extend your Java program to include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
- **Requirements**:
    - Add functionality to insert new records into the database.
    - Update existing records based on specific conditions.
    - Delete records from the database.

### Optional Bonus Challenge: Transaction Management
- **Objective**: Implement basic transaction management in your Java program.
- **Requirements**:
    - Incorporate transaction management with commit and rollback.
    - Ensure that your operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your source code files with clearly commented code.
- Ensure your code is well-structured and follows Java coding standards.
- Include a brief report explaining your approach and any challenges faced.

Good luck!
